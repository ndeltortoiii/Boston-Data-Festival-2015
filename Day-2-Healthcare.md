#Practical Data Science: The WPC Healthcare Strategy for Dleivering Meaningful Data Science Projects—Damien Mingle, WPC Healthcare
——————————————————————————————

###command line: jupyter notebook
will be using markdown

###Joe Data Science
doesn’t capture business needs 

Models are not production quality

###Why Jupyter: interactive computing environment
Notebook web application: writing and running code

###data science methodology
strategically: provides confidence to business that data science projects can be delivered profitably

Tactically: Management can understand status assessments

Operationally: empowers the data science team to do the right thing, right way, right time

###Business Understanding
Understand the data science project objectives and requirements form a business perspective.  Then convert this knowledge into a data science problem definition and preliminary plan designed to achieve the objective.

determine biz objectives

assess situation

determine data science goals

produce project plan

###Evaluation
Where you want to be the most comprehensive

At the end of this phrase a decision on the use of the data science results should be reached

Review your steps with certainty

evaluate results

review process

determine next steps

###Deployment
This phase can be as simple as generating a report or as complex as implementing a repeatable data science process across the enterprise

Make Use of the Model

Plan deployment

Plan monitoring and maintenance

Produce final report

Review project

#Exercise 1:
Choose between A and B

###A is 3 lines of what we are going to do

###*B is PHASE I: Business Understanding*

###Determine Business Objectives
1. Background
 
 - Organization
  - Problem Area
  - Current Solution (Description, Advantages/Disadvantages)
2. Business Objectives (Primary, Other, Benefits)
3. Business Success Criteria

###Assess Situation
1. Inventory of resources (Personal Sources, Sources of Data Knowledge, Computing Resources
2. Requirements, assumptions & constraints
3. Risks and Contingencies
4. Terminology (log loss, gradient boosted machines, random forest)
5. Costs and Benefits

###Determine Data Science Goals
1. Data Science Goals
2. Data Science Success Criteria

###Produce Project Plan
1. Project Plan
2. Initial Assessments of Tools and Techniques

#*Exercise 2: PHASE II: Data Understanding*
one is database oriented the other is data exploration you choose which one you want to use

###A
###Collect Initial Data
Table Name, purpose

Table: Key, Column Name, Data Type, Description

###Describe Data Analysis

###Explore Data Report

###Verify Data Quality Report

###B
###Collect Initial Data Report

###Describe Data Output 
Continuous Features

Categorical Features

###Explore Data

###Data Quality Summary

#*Exercise 3: PHASE III: Data Preparation*

###A
Select Data: rationals for inclusions/exclusions

Clean Data: data cleaning report

Construct Data: Derived attributes, generated records

Integrate Data: merged data

Format Data: reformatted data

###B

#*Exercise 4: PHASE IV: Modeling*

###A
Select Modeling Technique and assumptions

Generate Test Design

Build Model (Gradient Boosting Machine, Random Forest)

Code

###B
same titles, shorter

#*Exercise 5: PHASE V: Evaluation*

###A
###Evaluate Results
1. Assessment of Data Science Results
2. Approved models

Review Process

Determine Next Steps

###B
same titles more detail/ results from models

next steps with options and decisions

#*Exercise 6: PHASE VI: Deployment*
Plan Deployment

Plan Monitoring and Maintenance

Monitor and Maintenance Plan

Produce Final Report

Review Project

- talk about the roads not taken, why you didn’t and what would have happened if you had
 
###Data Scientist 2.0: Lead Analytically Your Organization
Use Jupyter to document your process—real time—using whatever language you want

Establish a Data Science Methodology that is comprehensive

Provide insights that help the organization make better decisions to solve their business problem

Common Interview Question: Have you worked on something through deployment

Reach out to Damien Mingle

iterative approach

be transparent when you are expected to be on 3rd base and you are still warming up

can’t make gold out of hay

###Questions
Secondary market for finding if individuals over-billed and you get a chunk of the over-billing

EMR feeds specifically related to population health

Produce metrics that are audited each year

Text mining natural language processing out of that blob of text

###Predicting anomalies against historical records (what ZirMed does)
have 2,500 rules published by medicare coded

population health reporting used for something that is different from what HRQ (health risk questionnaire) is requesting

have a decision model and then just scoring, run model learning to convergence and shipped to production, decision tree has API to score through it, maye baisse model

###Start Biz Opportunity: do the same thing by having rules for another industry
